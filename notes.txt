2016-03-24 Reading papers
-------------------------

I'm also interested in these stochastic methods to train complex deep learning
models.

Project: improve SAGA with GradientWaste
Roles: each of us take on a potential acceleration

SVRG vs SAGA: computation vs memory (SVRG only for strongly convex)
Idea: play on this trade-off
I would prefer a simple (albeit sub-optimal) algorithm than a set of tricks.

Tricks:
1. SVRG with error: approximate FG
   Not applicable as SAGA does not require any FG.
2. Mixed SG and SVRG: 1 eval per step at start
   Not applicable as SAGA only evaluates one gradient per step.
3. Support vectors: less evals at end

------------------------------

Incremental convex minimization algorithms

1. Play with trade-off of computation and memory of SAGA and SVRG. Memory constraint on SAGA
2. Distributing computations on more CPU.
3. Explore their application to minmax problems to find saddle points.
4. Fit statistical models. Apply these incremental algorithms to manifold
   optimization problems, e.g. GMM. Contact Reshad Hosseini.
5. Try to improve the proofs (bound or simplicity).
